Umwelt

Umwelt is a package manager. Using Umwelt you can fetch and create run-time
environments configured for a given set of packages.

However, unlike in other package managers, packages are not installed into
these standalone environments (pip, npm) or into a central
repository (REZ). Instead the install location of the packages on the
server stays untouched and is being managed by a registry instead.
