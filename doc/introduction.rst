Wiz is a package management system. It constructs a requirement graph from a
list a package requests and resolves it into a context mapping which contains
an environment mapping and a command mapping.

The commands can be launched within the resolved environment or be run directly.

It is developed in :term:`Python`.

Use :option:`wiz -h` to see all the options.

    Any design decisions can be followed up on in this
